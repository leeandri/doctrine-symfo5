Hi! So... I'm having a *weird* day. Yesterday, I cast a spell
to make my dishes wash themselves. But while I was casting it,
I slipped a little and I think `I also hit my pants with the spell`.
When I woke up this morning, I caught a quick glimpse of my pants
opening the front door and walking out! I've been out all afternoon
(with no pants mind you) searching for them.
Does anyone have a spell to call your pants back?
